To install:

Put the "ProcedualPlanets" folder in your KSP GameData folder.
(Yes, I misspelled it and I'm not fixing it.)

How to use:

Run the "GenerateSystem" file in the aforementioned "ProcedualPlanets" folder.
Input the numbers it asks you to input, and run the program!

IF the program randomly closes, that means an error occured.
This could be one of two things:

You inputted a value that isn't an integer (whole number)
or...
I did something wrong and you have the right to annoy me until I fix it.


How to delete your systems if you don't like them:

Replace the "ProcedualPlanets" folder in your KSP GameData folder. You can also go the long route and delete the individual Kopernicus configs, EVE configs, Scatterer configs, textures, and the cache.
