"We need whimsical loading tips now." -Sushut, prior to quoting himself.
Changing display names in the planet's config...
Screwing up gas giants... Really badly.
Making comically oversized moons...
Not naming the mod "Sus Hut Architecture of Terrestrials (S.H.A.T)"
Somehow getting shorelines wrong every time...
Binary-ing stars...
Letting people use generated textures (huge mistake.)
NOT approaching Kagittarius A* under ANY circumstances.
Moving Kerbin...
Using simplex noise...
Finding out that noise octaves didn't have to be THAT high...
Finding habitable worlds...
Goingly boldly...
Looking back at the old terrain generation (foul.)
Collecting mods in order to actually visit any stars...
Forgetting Kopernicus...
Trying your absolute hardest to find a planet with blue skies...
Poking head into a neutron star's accretion disk...
